## Who We Are

The Canada Export Promotion Council (CEPROC.CA) is the authoritative, private-sector body dedicated to advancing Canada's interests in the global marketplace. We don't just facilitate trade; we shape the conditions that make Canadian exports resilient, compliant, and globally competitive.

## Our Mission: Advocacy, Integrity, and Growth

Our existence is defined by a singular purpose: to elevate the Canadian export ecosystem by ensuring our partners succeed on the world stage. This mission is driven by our commitment to three core values:

- **Advocacy** – To be the relentless voice of Canadian exporters, ensuring favorable trade environments, addressing bureaucratic hurdles, and influencing the national policy agenda.
- **Integrity** – To establish a benchmark of trust by meticulously vetting every producer and buyer in our network, guaranteeing reliable partnerships and ethical trade practices.
- **Growth** – To foster sustainable international revenue streams for our members through strategic market intelligence and high-value connectivity.

## What Makes CEPROC.CA Unique?

We distinguish ourselves by focusing on the pillars that matter most to serious B2B export success: Policy and Connectivity. We move beyond simple business listing to provide actionable, government-level support.

### Policy Driven, Government Connected

We maintain active relationships with federal and provincial policymakers, regulators, and international trade bodies. This proximity allows us to deliver proactive intelligence on upcoming regulatory changes, tariff negotiations, and trade agreement updates (like CUSMA and CETA). When a policy is being written, our members' interests are already in the room.

### A Vetted Network, Not an Open Directory

Unlike general trade directories, CEPROC.CA operates a strictly vetted network. We certify Canadian producers for export readiness and pre-qualify foreign buyers for financial capacity and ethical standards. This selective process ensures that when a connection is made through us, it is a high-probability, low-risk partnership.

### Strategic Market Making

We don't chase every market; we target the right ones. Our specialized intelligence team provides data-driven analysis on geopolitical risks, consumer trends, and optimal entry strategies for high-growth regions, allowing our members to invest their time and capital where it will generate the highest return.

## Our Commitment to You

Whether you are a Canadian producer seeking to scale, a foreign buyer demanding verified quality, or a government stakeholder needing expert insight, CEPROC.CA is committed to being the most authoritative, reliable, and effective resource in Canadian trade.

**We are not just a council; we are the engine room of Canada's global trade ambition.**
