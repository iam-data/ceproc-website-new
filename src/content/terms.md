## 2. The CEPROC Vetting & Partnership Program

### 2.1. Vetting Application and Integrity

Application for the **CEPROC Vetting Status** requires the submission of truthful, accurate, and complete company, financial, compliance, and operational data. You warrant that all information provided during the application and subsequent monitoring phases is current and non-misleading.

### 2.2. Vetting Status and Monitoring

CEPROC.CA reserves the right, at its sole discretion, to:

- **Deny** Vetting Status to any applicant.
- **Revoke or Suspend** Vetting Status at any time based on failed compliance audits, regulatory breaches, or evidence of material misrepresentation.
- **Conduct Continuous Monitoring** of compliance records, legal standing, and public record data.

### 2.3. The CEPROC Verified Seal

The **CEPROC Verified** seal, logo, and Vetting Status are proprietary marks of CEPROC.CA.

- **License:** Use of the seal is a limited, non-transferable, revocable license granted solely during the period of active, valid Vetting Status.
- **Prohibited Use:** Any unauthorized use of the seal, including displaying it after status is revoked or implying Vetting Status where none exists, is a breach of these Terms and may result in legal action.

### 2.4. Fees and Payment

All membership, Vetting, and Certification fees (including the CDTCO Program) are payable upon invoice. All fees are **non-refundable**, except as otherwise stipulated in a separate written membership agreement or required by Canadian consumer protection law.

## 3. Verified Connectivity and Introductions

### 3.1. Facilitator Role

CEPROC.CA acts strictly as a neutral, trusted facilitator providing **Direct Introductions** between Vetted Producers and pre-qualified International Buyers. CEPROC.CA does not participate in the negotiation, sale, financing, or execution of any resulting trade agreement.

### 3.2. No Guarantee of Outcome

CEPROC.CA does not guarantee export success, minimum sales volumes, buyer performance, payment, or contract fulfillment. Users are solely responsible for conducting their own final due diligence, contracting, and managing risks associated with any transaction resulting from a CEPROC introduction.

## 4. Intellectual Property and Data Use

### 4.1. CEPROC.CA Proprietary Content

All content, designs, trademarks, service marks, algorithms, and proprietary data models (including the **Regulatory Bottleneck Index (RBI)**, Market Data Reports, Policy Briefs, and the **CEPROC Verified** seal) are the exclusive intellectual property of CEPROC.CA.

### 4.3. Use of Member Data

By submitting data for Vetting, the Member grants CEPROC a worldwide, non-exclusive, royalty-free license to use, aggregate, and anonymize such data for the purpose of generating industry reports, policy papers, and other data products, in accordance with the CEPROC Privacy Policy.

## 5. User Obligations and Prohibited Conduct
