# CEPROC.CA Accessibility Statement

## Our Commitment to Accessibility

The **Canadian Export Promotion Council (CEPROC.CA)** is fundamentally committed to ensuring that our digital resources, services, and proprietary content are accessible to all users, regardless of technology or ability. We believe that equitable access to global trade information and networking is essential to our mission of promoting Canadian growth.

We strive to create an inclusive environment that allows people with disabilities to engage with our platform independently and effectively.

## Digital Accessibility Standards

CEPROC.CA is actively working to meet and exceed the following standards for digital accessibility:

1. **Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG) 2.1 Level AA:** We aim for conformance with WCAG 2.1 Level AA, which provides standards for making web content perceivable, operable, understandable, and robust.
2. **Accessibility for Ontarians with Disabilities Act (AODA):** As a Canadian organization, we comply with the *Information and Communications Standard* requirements under the AODA, integrating accessibility into our digital development lifecycle.

## Accessibility Features and Measures

We have implemented the following features to ensure a high level of accessibility across the CEPROC.CA platform:

### A. Perceivable

- **Semantic Markup:** Using HTML5 elements correctly to provide clear structure (headings, lists, landmarks) for screen readers and assistive technology.
- **High Contrast:** Maintaining a minimum contrast ratio of 4.5:1 for all text and background elements to ensure readability for users with low vision or color blindness.
- **Descriptive Text:** All non-text content, including data visualizations (like the RBI charts) and the **CEPROC Verified** seal, is provided with meaningful alternative text (alt attributes).
- **Text Resizing:** Users can resize text up to 200% without loss of content or functionality.

### B. Operable

- **Keyboard Navigation:** The entire website and all interactive elements (navigation, forms, buttons, links) can be fully operated using only a keyboard (Tab, Enter, Spacebar).
- **Focus Indicators:** Clear and visible focus indicators (outlines) are used to show users where they are on the page during keyboard navigation.
- **Consistent Navigation:** The main navigation structure, including headers and footers, is consistent across all pages, aiding in predictability.
- **Time Limits:** Where user sessions have time limits (e.g., login or application forms), users are provided with sufficient time and the ability to extend the session.

### C. Understandable

- **Form Clarity:** All online application forms (Vetting, Buyer Inquiry) include clear labels, visible instructions, and explicit error identification and suggestions for correction.
- **Plain Language:** We strive to write policy summaries and site instructions using clear, jargon-free language appropriate for our audience.
- **Predictable Design:** Interface elements behave in predictable ways, preventing unexpected changes in context upon interaction.

## Alternative Formats

We recognize that some of our policy documents, regulatory checklists, and market data reports may be complex. If you are unable to access any content on our website, we will, upon request, provide the information or communication in an accessible format or with communication supports as soon as reasonably practicable.

## Reporting Barriers and Feedback

We view accessibility as a continuous, collaborative effort. If you encounter any barriers while using CEPROC.CA or have suggestions on how we can improve, please contact our Digital Compliance Team immediately.

**How to Reach Us:**

**When reporting a barrier, please specify:**

1. The nature of the accessibility barrier.
2. The specific URL or page where the barrier occurred.
3. The assistive technology (e.g., screen reader, browser) you were using.

We commit to acknowledging all accessibility feedback within **two (2) business days** and working diligently to resolve identified issues.

## Ongoing Improvement and Review

CEPROC.CA is committed to an annual review of its digital properties. This includes:

- Conducting accessibility audits using both automated tools and manual testing with assistive technology.
- Providing ongoing accessibility training to our content, design, and development teams.
- Integrating accessibility requirements into the procurement and development of all new digital products.
