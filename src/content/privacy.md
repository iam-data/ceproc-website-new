# CEPROC.CA Privacy Policy

**Effective Date:** December 16, 2025  
**Last Reviewed:** December 16, 2025

The **Canadian Export Promotion Council (CEPROC.CA)** is committed to protecting the privacy of the personal and proprietary business information of our members, clients, and website visitors. This Policy adheres to the principles of the *Personal Information Protection and Electronic Documents Act (PIPEDA)* and relevant Canadian provincial privacy laws.

## 1. Scope and Compliance (Adherence to PIPEDA)

This policy governs our conduct in the collection, use, and disclosure of personal information, following the ten fair information principles outlined in PIPEDA. This policy applies to all data collected through the CEPROC.CA website, applications, and direct service interactions.

## 2. Information We Collect

We collect information necessary to deliver our core services: Vetting, Policy Advocacy, and Verified Connectivity.

### 2.1. Member & Vetting Data (Proprietary & Sensitive)

This data is provided by Canadian Producers and service providers seeking the CEPROC Vetting Status:

- **Personal Identifiers:** Names, titles, contact information (email, phone) of principal officers, compliance contacts, and authorized representatives.
- **Business Identifiers:** Company name, registration, Canadian tax/business numbers (used for verification, never disclosed publicly).
- **Proprietary Operational Data:** Export capacity, supply chain stability information, compliance records, and certain aggregated financial health indicators required for the Vetting assessment.

### 2.2. Buyer & Sourcing Data

This data is provided by International Buyers and Trade Commissions:

- Global buyer company name, country of operation, specific procurement criteria, and key contact details.

### 2.3. Digital Products & Website Data

- Browser data, IP addresses, cookie information, usage patterns, and download history of Policy Briefs or training modules.

## 3. How We Use Your Information

We use the collected information for the following purposes:

- **Core Service Delivery:** To perform the comprehensive audit necessary to grant or revoke the **CEPROC Vetting Status**.
- **Future Connectivity:** To facilitate **Direct Introductions** between vetted producers and pre-qualified buyers (only upon explicit consent from both parties).
- **Policy and Data Products:** To generate aggregated and anonymized market intelligence (e.g., the **Regulatory Bottleneck Index** or Market Briefs) to drive our advocacy mission.
- **Account Management:** To manage subscriptions, billing, and provide secure access to member resources and the CDTCO program.
- **Security and Integrity:** To maintain system integrity, prevent fraud, and ensure compliance with our Terms of Service and Canadian regulations.

## 4. Consent and Disclosure

### 4.1. Obtaining Consent

By submitting a Vetting Application, registering for services, or creating an account, users explicitly consent to the collection and use of their information as described in this Policy.

Users may withdraw consent at any time, subject to legal or contractual restrictions, by contacting the Privacy Officer. Withdrawal of consent may prevent CEPROC from providing certain services, such as maintaining a valid Vetting Status.

### 4.2. Disclosure to Third Parties

- **Networking:** We will disclose a Member Producer's **Vetting Status, Export Capacity, and Product Category** to potential Verified International Buyers for matchmaking only after securing **specific, affirmative consent** for that introduction.
- **Anonymized Data:** Aggregated and anonymized data (e.g., the RBI metrics) may be sold or licensed to third-party institutions (such as banks or academic bodies). This data is rigorously processed to prevent the identification of any individual or single company's trade secrets.
- **Legal Requirements:** Disclosure will occur only if required by law, subpoena, governmental request, or to protect the rights and safety of CEPROC.CA, our members, or the public.

## 5. Security and Data Sovereignty

We employ robust physical, organizational, and technological safeguards appropriate to the sensitivity of the information.

- **Canadian Hosting:** All sensitive data is stored on secure, **Canadian-based cloud infrastructure** to ensure compliance with data sovereignty expectations and to mitigate risks associated with foreign access (e.g., the U.S. CLOUD Act).
- **Encryption:** Data is protected in transit (TLS 1.2+) and at rest (AES-256 encryption).
- **Access Control:** Access to sensitive data is strictly limited via the **Principle of Least Privilege** and audited regularly.

## 6. Access and Accuracy

CEPROC.CA is committed to maintaining accurate, complete, and up-to-date records. Members have the right to request access to their own personal and proprietary business information held by CEPROC. We will respond to all requests for access or correction within 30 days of receiving a written request.

## 7. Data Retention

We retain personal and proprietary information only as long as necessary to fulfill the purpose(s) for which it was collected, or to satisfy legal, regulatory, or accountability requirements. Vetting records necessary for auditing integrity are retained for a minimum of seven (7) years after membership termination.

## 8. Contacting the Privacy Officer

All questions, concerns, or complaints regarding this Privacy Policy or CEPROC's privacy practices should be directed to our designated Privacy Officer:

**Privacy Officer:** Digital Compliance Department  
**Email:** [privacy@ceproc.ca](mailto:privacy@ceproc.ca)
